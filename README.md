alignment: "Neutral Evil"
ac: 15
hp: "7 (2d6)"
speed: "30 ft"
cr: "1/4"
scores: [8, 14, 10, 10, 8, 8]
saves:
  - dex
skills:
  - "Stealth": 6
senses: "Darkvision 60 ft, Passive Perception 9"

actions:
  - name: "Scimitar"
    desc: "Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage."
